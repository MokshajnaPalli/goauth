## 🔍 How to Use goauth
After you successfully run the application, follow these steps to set up authentication:

1. **Create a Configuration File**: Goauth requires a configuration file in JSON format to manage authentication options. Create a file named `config.json`. 
   ```json
   {
      "auth_method": "basic",
      "users": [
         {
            "username": "user1",
            "password": "password1"
         }
      ]
   }
   ```
   Adjust the contents as needed for your specific users.

2. **Load the Configuration**: When you start goauth, it will automatically look for this `config.json` file in the same directory.

3. **Test Your Setup**: Access the application in your browser or via your service to ensure everything is running smoothly.
